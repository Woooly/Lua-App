Lua-App is a Full-Stack Web Application developed using the MERN Stack, designed to provide users with complete control and clear visibility over their personal finances. The core objective of this project is to deliver an intuitive and responsive interface for the daily logging of expenses and incomes, facilitating the identification of spending patterns and promoting overall financial health.



This application serves as a demonstration of proficiency in modern software architecture, integrating:







Front-end (React): A dynamic and user-friendly interface built with a declarative approach, utilizing State Management (useState) for real-time updates and seamless user experience.



Back-end (Node.js \& Express): Development of a robust RESTful API, responsible for business logic, user authentication (Login/Password), and secure data routing.



Database (MongoDB): Implementation of a non-relational database for efficient and scalable storage of financial information, ensuring data persistence and security.
